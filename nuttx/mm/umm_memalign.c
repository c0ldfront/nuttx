 * Name: memalign
 *
 * Description:
 *   memalign requests more than enough space from malloc, finds a region
 *   within that chunk that meets the alignment request and then frees any
 *   leading or trailing space.
 *
 *   The alignment argument must be a power of two (not checked).  8-byte
 *   alignment is guaranteed by normal malloc calls.
